# Breakable Wall Randomizer v3.0.0.0

Main changes:
- Rebuilt every single name, term and logic definition from the mod. Details about them in the readme. (DONE)
- Added FStats integration: goals will include obtaining all walls from a given group, destroying all walls, planks or dive floors. This will always track activity as long as the mod is enabled, even if nothing is randomized. (IN PROGRESS 6/9)
- Added Myla shop with breakable items as costs. (DONE)
- Reworked tutorial floor - now an item will destroy both the big floor and the wooden plank. This will avoid impossible seed definitions and also add some constraints to KP items if enabled. (DONE)

Bug fixes:
- Several logic bugs that caused false positives and negatives fixed. (UNDER VALIDATION)
- RMM pins being weirdly located has been dealt with. (IN PROGRESS 25/146)
- Brooding Mawlek shortcut wall item now correctly unlocks the left transition in Crossroads_33. (DONE)
- Archives shortcut wall item now correctly unlocks the left transition in Fungal3_47. (DONE)
- Shade soul shortcut location shouldn't be indestructible if accessed from the left/bot transitions. (DONE)
